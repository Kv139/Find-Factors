# find_factors

Version.pl is a program written in prolog designed to find all rational factors of all polynomials of degree two or less. The program works by generating
factors of the leading ooefficient and the ending coefficient. It then uses this list to then find all rational zeros of the polynomial. The program can unify
and test all polynomials in the knowledge base or a specific instance which it is called with.
